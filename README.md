# FireDucks-vs-Pandas

This project benchmarks two powerful data processing libraries ‚Äî **Pandas** and **FireDucks** ‚Äî using a structured dataset to evaluate their performance in handling typical data engineering tasks.

We applied real-world data operations on a **Wine Reviews** dataset to compare execution times and understand where FireDucks gives a speed boost.

##  Purpose

This project is designed to demonstrate how **FireDucks** performs significantly better than traditional **Pandas** when working with large-scale datasets.

Through real-world benchmarking, it highlights:

-  FireDucks' ability to efficiently process big data
-  The limitations of Pandas with memory and execution time
-  Faster execution of key operations like GroupBy, Filtering, and Sorting
-  How FireDucks enables scalable data workflows

Perfect for **Data Engineers**, **Analysts**, or anyone handling large volumes of data and curious about performance differences between data processing tools.
